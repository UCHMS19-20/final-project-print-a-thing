# Intro to Programming Final Project - Plaform to Print

This game is a basic platformer wher the goal is to reach the "file" that has your final paper in it, allowing it to print

## Controls

The player moves around the screen by pressing on the arrow keys on the keyboard.
* Right arrow moves right
* Left arrow moves left
* Up arrow jumps, but only when on a platform
* Down arrow does...nothing
Holding a side arrow will cause the player to move faster, and these buttons can be held while in the air.

## How to Win

The player wins the game by using the platforms to jump around and arrive at the sprite representing the paper file. The game is won when the player and the file collide. However, the player will lose grade levels (lives) if they miss a platform and hit the ground. After losing five grade levels the player loses the game.

## Files
